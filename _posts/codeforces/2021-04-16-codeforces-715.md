# A. Average Height

Sayaka Saeki is a member of the student council, which has 𝑛 other members (excluding Sayaka). The $𝑖$-th member has a height of $𝑎_𝑖$ millimeters.

It's the end of the school year and Sayaka wants to take a picture of all other members of the student council. Being the hard-working and perfectionist girl as she is, she wants to arrange all the members in a line such that the amount of photogenic consecutive pairs of members is **as large as possible**.

A pair of two consecutive members $𝑢$ and $𝑣$ on a line is considered photogenic if their average height is an integer, i.e. $\frac{𝑎_𝑢+𝑎_𝑣}{2}$ is an integer.

Help Sayaka arrange the other members to **maximize** the number of photogenic consecutive pairs.

### Input
The first line contains a single integer $𝑡$ $(1≤𝑡≤500)$ — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $𝑛$ $(2≤𝑛≤2000)$  — the number of other council members.

The second line of each test case contains $𝑛$ integers $𝑎_1, 𝑎_2, ..., 𝑎_𝑛$ $(1≤𝑎_𝑖≤2⋅10^5)$  — the heights of each of the other members in millimeters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $𝑛$ over all test cases does not exceed 2000.

### Output
For each test case, output on one line $𝑛$ integers representing the heights of the other members in the order, which gives the largest number of photogenic consecutive pairs. If there are multiple such orders, output any of them.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
const char nl = '\n';

void solve() {
    int n; cin >> n;
    vector<int> A, B;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x; cin >> x;
        if (x % 2) A.push_back(x);
        else B.push_back(x);
    }
    for (auto& x : A) cout << x << " ";
    for (auto& x : B) cout << k << " ";
    cout << nl;
}

# B. TMT Document

The student council has a shared document file. Every day, some members of the student council write the sequence `TMT` (short for Towa Maji Tenshi) in it.

However, one day, the members somehow entered the sequence into the document at the same time, creating a jumbled mess. Therefore, it is Suguru Doujima's task to figure out whether the document has malfunctioned. Specifically, he is given a string of length $𝑛$ whose characters are all either `T` or `M`, and he wants to figure out if it is possible to partition it into some number of disjoint subsequences, all of which are equal to `TMT`. That is, each character of the string should belong to exactly one of the subsequences.

A string $𝑎$ is a subsequence of a string 𝑏 if $𝑎$ can be obtained from $𝑏$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero) characters.

### Input
The first line contains an integer $𝑡$ $(1≤𝑡≤5000)$  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $𝑛$ $(3≤𝑛<10^5)$, the number of characters in the string entered in the document. It is guaranteed that $𝑛$ is divisible by $3$.

The second line of each test case contains a string of length $𝑛$ consisting of only the characters `T` and `M`.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $𝑛$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing `YES` if the described partition exists, and a single line containing `NO` otherwise.

# C. The Sports Festival

The student council is preparing for the relay race at the sports festival.

The council consists of $𝑛$ members. They will run one after the other in the race, the speed of member $𝑖$ is $𝑠_𝑖$. The discrepancy $𝑑_𝑖$ of the 𝑖-th stage is the difference between the maximum and the minimum running speed among the first $𝑖$ members who ran. Formally, if $𝑎_𝑖$ denotes the speed of the $𝑖$-th member who participated in the race, then $𝑑𝑖=max(𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑖)−min(𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑖)$.

You want to minimize the sum of the discrepancies $𝑑_1+𝑑_2+⋯+𝑑_𝑛$. To do this, you are allowed to change the order in which the members run. What is the minimum possible sum that can be achieved?

### Input
The first line contains a single integer $𝑛$ $(1≤𝑛≤2000)$  — the number of members of the student council.

The second line contains $𝑛$ integers $𝑠_1,𝑠_2,…,𝑠_𝑛$ $(1≤𝑠_𝑖≤10^9)$  – the running speeds of the members.

### Output
Print a single integer  — the minimum possible value of $𝑑_1+𝑑_2+⋯+𝑑_𝑛$ after choosing the order of the members.
