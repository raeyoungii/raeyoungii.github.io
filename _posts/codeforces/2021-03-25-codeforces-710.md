# A. Strange Table

Polycarp found a rectangular table consisting of $𝑛$ rows and $𝑚$ columns. He noticed that each cell of the table has its number, obtained by the following algorithm **"by columns"**:

 * cells are numbered starting from one;
 * cells are numbered from left to right by columns, and inside each column from top to bottom;
 * number of each cell is an integer one greater than in the previous cell. 

For example, if $𝑛=3$ and $𝑚=5$, the table will be numbered as follows:
```
1  4  7  10  13
2  5  8  11  14
3  6  9  12  15
```

However, Polycarp considers such numbering inconvenient. He likes the numbering **"by rows"**:

* cells are numbered starting from one;
* cells are numbered from top to bottom by rows, and inside each row from left to right;
* number of each cell is an integer one greater than the number of the previous cell. 

For example, if $𝑛=3$ and $𝑚=5$, then Polycarp likes the following table numbering:
```
 1   2   3   4   5
 6   7   8   9  10
11  12  13  14  15
```

Polycarp doesn't have much time, so he asks you to find out what would be the cell number in the numbering **"by rows"**, if in the numbering **"by columns"** the cell has the number $𝑥$?

### Input
The first line contains a single integer $𝑡$ $(1≤𝑡≤10^4)$. Then $𝑡$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers $𝑛, 𝑚, 𝑥$ $(1≤𝑛,𝑚≤10^6, 1≤𝑥≤𝑛⋅𝑚)$, where $𝑛$ and $𝑚$ are the number of rows and columns in the table, and $𝑥$ is the cell number.

Note that the numbers in some test cases do not fit into the $32$-bit integer type, so you must use at least the $64$-bit integer type of your programming language.

### Output
For each test case, output the cell number in the numbering $"by rows"$.

# B. Partial Replacement

You are given a number $𝑘$ and a string $𝑠$ of length $𝑛$, consisting of the characters `'.'` and `'*'`. You want to replace some of the `'*'` characters with `'x'` characters so that the following conditions are met:

* The first character `'*'` in the original string should be replaced with `'x'`;
* The last character `'*'` in the original string should be replaced with `'x'`;
* The distance between two neighboring replaced characters `'x'` must not exceed $𝑘$ (more formally, if you replaced characters at positions $𝑖$ and $𝑗$ $(𝑖<𝑗)$ and at positions $[𝑖+1,𝑗−1]$ there is no `"x"` symbol, then $𝑗−𝑖$ must be no more than $𝑘$). 

For example, if $𝑛=7$, $𝑠=$`.**.***` and $𝑘=3$, then the following strings will satisfy the conditions above:

* `.xx.*xx;`
* `.x*.x*x;`
* `.xx.xxx.`

But, for example, the following strings will not meet the conditions:

* `.**.*xx` (the first character `'*'` should be replaced with `'x'`);
* `.x*.xx*` (the last character `'*'` should be replaced with `'x'`);
* `.x*.*xx` (the distance between characters at positions $2$ and $6$ is greater than $𝑘=3$). 

Given $𝑛$, $𝑘$, and $𝑠$, find the minimum number of `'*'` characters that must be replaced with `'x'` in order to meet the above conditions.

### Input
The first line contains one integer $𝑡$ $(1≤𝑡≤500)$. Then $𝑡$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $𝑛$ and $𝑘$ $(1≤𝑘≤𝑛≤50)$.

The second line of each test case contains a string $𝑠$ of length$𝑛$, consisting of the characters `'.'` and `'*'`.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one `'*'` in the string $𝑠$.

It is guaranteed that the distance between any two neighboring `'*'` characters does not exceed $𝑘$.

### Output
For each test case output the minimum number of `'*'` characters that must be replaced with `'x'` characters in order to satisfy the conditions above.

# C. Double-ended Strings

You are given the strings $𝑎$ and $𝑏$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You can do any number of the following operations in any order:

* if $\|𝑎\|>0$ (the length of the string $𝑎$ is greater than zero), delete the first character of the string $𝑎$, that is, replace $𝑎$ with $𝑎_2𝑎_3…𝑎_𝑛$;
* if $\|𝑎\|>0$, delete the last character of the string $𝑎$, that is, replace $𝑎$ with $𝑎_1𝑎_2…𝑎_{𝑛−1}$;
* if $\|𝑏\|>0$ (the length of the string $𝑏$ is greater than zero), delete the first character of the string $𝑏$, that is, replace $𝑏$ with $𝑏_2𝑏_3…𝑏_𝑛$;
* if $\|𝑏\|>0$, delete the last character of the string $𝑏$, that is, replace $𝑏$ with $𝑏_1𝑏_2…𝑏_{𝑛−1}$. 

Note that after each of the operations, the string $𝑎$ or $𝑏$ may become empty.

For example, if $𝑎=$`"hello"` and $𝑏=$`"icpc"`, then you can apply the following sequence of operations:

* delete the first character of the string $𝑎$ ⇒ $𝑎=$`"ello"` and $𝑏=$`"icpc"`;
* delete the first character of the string $𝑏$ ⇒ $𝑎=$`"ello"` and $𝑏=$`"cpc"`;
* delete the first character of the string $𝑏$ ⇒ $𝑎=$`"ello"` and $𝑏=$`"pc"`;
* delete the last character of the string $𝑎$ ⇒ $𝑎=$`"ell"` and $𝑏=$`"pc"`;
* delete the last character of the string $𝑏$ ⇒ $𝑎=$`"ell"` and $𝑏=$`"p"`. 

For the given strings $𝑎$ and $𝑏$, find the minimum number of operations for which you can make the strings $𝑎$ and $𝑏$ equal. Note that empty strings are also equal.

### Input
The first line contains a single integer $𝑡$ $(1≤𝑡≤100)$. Then $𝑡$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the string $𝑎$ $(1≤\|𝑎\|≤20)$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The second line of each test case contains the string $𝑏$ $(1≤\|𝑏\|≤20)$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

### Output
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations that can make the strings $𝑎$ and $𝑏$ equal.

# D. Epic Transformation

You are given an array $𝑎$ of length $𝑛$ consisting of integers. You can apply the following operation, consisting of several steps, on the array $𝑎$ zero or more times:

* you select two different numbers in the array $𝑎_𝑖$ and $𝑎_𝑗$;
* you remove $𝑖$-th and $𝑗$-th elements from the array. 

For example, if $𝑛=6$ and $𝑎=[1,6,1,1,4,4]$, then you can perform the following sequence of operations:

* select $𝑖=1,𝑗=5$. The array $𝑎$ becomes equal to $[6,1,1,4]$;
* select $𝑖=1,𝑗=2$. The array $𝑎$ becomes equal to $[1,4]$. 

What can be the minimum size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it?

### Input
The first line contains a single integer $𝑡$ $(1≤𝑡≤10^4)$. Then $𝑡$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $𝑛$ $(1≤𝑛≤2⋅10^5)$ is length of the array $𝑎$.

The second line of each test case contains $𝑛$ integers $𝑎_1,𝑎_2,…,𝑎_𝑛$ ($1≤𝑎_𝑖≤10^9)$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $𝑛$ over all test cases does not exceed $2⋅10^5$.

### Output
For each test case, output the minimum possible size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it.
